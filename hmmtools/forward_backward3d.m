% Implements the forward-backward  algorithm for 3-dimensional HMM's
% (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward%E2%80%93backward_algorithm ) 
% author: Joshua Slocum
         
% Inputs:
% packed_3d_hmm: the 3d hmm model with which to begin training. See utils/pack3DHMM.m for more details.
% seq1: the data sequence that model 1 explains.
% seq2: the data sequence that model 2 explains.
% seq3: the data sequence that model 3 explains.


% Outputs:
% forward_probabilities: a 4-dimensional matrix with the calculated forward probabilities for each state of model 1, state of model 2, state of model 3,  and timestep.
% backward_probabilities: a 4-dimensional matrix with the calculated backward probabilities for each state of model 1, state of model 2, state of model 3, and timestep.
% normalization_factors: factoor by which the forward and backward probabilities are scaled at each time step for numeric stability
